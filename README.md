Tilemap
=======

QuiteSimpleTilemap

On Map.txt we define the MAP we want pinted, 
the first value will be the path of the tileset we will use (if the tileset is in the same folder will be only the name of it).
The next two parameteers will be the width and height of the tiles in the tileset.
The next two will be the amount of tiles that the map will have as the map width and height using tiles as unit.
The next values will be each tile we define, for each one, we will use 0,0 0,1 1,0 and 1,1 to define each color of the tileset meaning the first number the x position and the second one the y one.


To use it, it is needed SFML libs, on Ubuntu 14 they are already included, in another Operating sistem, you will need to install them
For Windows, in Visual studio (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php) 
for Linux users (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-linux.php), and for MAC OS (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-osx.php) .

Thanks to SFML
